### ~~WSAssetPickerController~~ ðŸŒ‡

This project is out of date with iOS and has been deprecated. The last version [0.2.1](https://github.com/wessmith/WSAssetPickerController/releases/latest) will remain available via CocoaPods.

### Other Options

There are plenty of other options for similar [libraries](https://cocoapods.org/?q=photo%20picker) available via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

Another solution might be to use the the [Photos framework added by Apple in iOS 8](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Photos/Reference/Photos_Framework/).
